					Magikarp is a medium-sized fish Pokémon with large, heavy reddish-orange scales. It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white, but it has a stiff, three-peaked fin on its back and stomach that are both yellow. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female and tan on a male.
A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. Many people are surprised by the utter strength of Magicarp and its ability to take lots of hits before going down. With strong water skills such as the famed splash, Magicarp is a must have for all trainers. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds.

					Seadra is a blue, seahorse-like Pokémon. It has a long snout and a two fin-like ridges curving over either side of its head. Its belly is covered with rough, cream-colored scales. Seadra's lower pectoral fins have sharp, pointed, cream-colored tips that exude venom. It also has a large, coiled tail.
Seadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail. It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools. When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout. Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce fainting in humans, but is prized among practitioners of traditional medicine.
Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean. After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young. It is markedly vicious, and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest.

					Marshtomp is an amphibious bipedal Pokémon. Its body is primarily light-blue with a lighter shade of blue for its underside and an orange belly. Marshtomp's head has an angular black fin, orange eyes, and orange gills on the ends of both cheeks. It has long arms with three-fingered hands. Its feet have three small toes, and it has two black fins for tails. This Pokémon has a thin, sticky film enveloping its body that enables it to live on land. Its body weakens if its skin dries out, so it plays in the mud on beaches when the tide is low to replenish fluids. It is capable of moving faster through mud than water. With its sturdy legs, it has good footing in mud that allows it to overwhelm struggling opponents. As its former signature move, Muddy Water is another special capability of this Pokémon. Marshtomp lives in swamps and other wetlands.

It has black, beady eyes and orange, star-shaped gills on its cheeks. By using the fin on its head, Mudkip is able to detect changes in air and water currents as well as bodies of water. Its fin can also point in a certain direction, as seen in the anime. Mudkip is capable of moving or crushing boulders larger than itself. Its large tail fin propels it through water with powerful acceleration.
According to its Pokémon Ranger browser entry, Mudkip is a very docile Pokémon. Mudkip lives in swamps and other wetlands, where it sleeps by burying itself in soil at the water’s edge.
