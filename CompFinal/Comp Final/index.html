				Pokemon are a great heritage for the people of the world. Ever since the radiation of theta power plants was found to mutate living organisms into interesting and loveable mutants people have been enamoured. The endless possibilities of what can be done with these creatures. From the sport of fighting pokemon to raising them as pets to using them for manual labor their special talents make them useful.

				The control of these pokemon has been perfected in the technique of creating pokeballs. These small balls are created out of special coconuts and through the use of science are made to fit these large pokemon inside of them. This process of going out into the wild and capturing pokemon for all purposes can be long and difficult depending on the type of pokemon. Certain areas must be sought out and time has to be taken to find them in their environment. Then a pokemon must already be owned to weaken the target pokemon before capture is possible. Instead we at team Aqua believe in the ablity of people everywhere to have their own pokemon without the hassle. We catch pokemon and use them for industrial purposes, private purposes, and finally for selling to the populace so that everyone can be a pokemon trainer.
