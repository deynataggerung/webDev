					Seedot is a small, brown Pokémon that resembles an acorn. It has a gray "cap" covering the top of its head, and a beige mask-like pattern on its face. Its eyes are large and black with beige pupils. It has two beige feet. Seedot live in forests. It sucks up moisture and nutrients from a tree when hanging from a branch using the top of its head. The more it drinks, the glossier its body becomes. After it finishes eating it becomes so heavy that it drops to the ground. When it remains still, it can be mistaken for a nut. It will startle Pokémon by moving suddenly. It uses leaves to polish its body once a day.

					Lotad is a small blue Pokémon with a yellow bill-like mouth and six small blue legs. It appears to have a lilypad on its back. It is believed that when a Lotad's leaf becomes too big, it starts to float on the water. However, if Lotad does not drink water for too long, the leaf on its head wilts. Lotad is able to float into the middle of ponds and lakes and photosynthesize food for itself without direct competition from others. Lotad is usually quite placid and easygoing. It can also serve as ferries for smaller Pokémon that can't swim. On rare occasions, it travels on land in search of clean water.

					Sceptile is a reptilian, bipedal Pokémon. Its neck is somewhat long, and it has two crests on its head. It has semicircular, yellow eyes with red rims. Its lower jaw and a belt-like band across its waist are also red. Along its back, it has two lines running down the middle and two rows of yellow nodules that are described as seeds. Its tail is shaped similar to that of a palm tree's branch. Both of its long arms have two sharp, elongated leaves and three claws. These leaves allow it to use its former signature move, Leaf Blade.
Sceptile is a jungle Pokémon. The seeds contain nutrients, which are said to be able to revitalize trees. It is capable of leaping freely from branch to branch. While it has the ability to slice down thick trees, it is known to care lovingly for the plants in the forest. This Pokémon regulates its body temperature by basking in sunlight.

					Treecko is a small, green, bipedal reptilian Pokémon. It has yellow eyes with long, narrow pupils. Treecko's hands and feet each have three digits covered with tiny spikes. These spikes allow it to scale vertical walls with ease. Its stomach and throat are red. It also has a line across on its stomach resembling a pouch. Treecko has a large, dark green tail with two separate lobes that it uses to sense humidity. This ability allows it to predict the next day's weather.
Treecko is a bit of a rarity in the wild, and is more common in captivity. However, when in the wild, Treecko lives inside overgrown forests. It makes its home in tall trees, and will attack anyone that comes near its nest. Because of its territorial nature, it is known to be the protector of the forest's trees. Treecko is known for its calm and collected personality. It will never panic under any circumstances, even when faced with a bigger foe.
